I’m @cecilsmith 😎 --a computer/software engineering dev attending the University of Minnesota and working on some pretty cool projects--

I've dabbled in all sorts of stuff: from game development in Unity, to programming and building drones, to Web development (HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js), Java ☕️, and C languages.

If you'd like to reach me about something, feel free to contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cecilnathanaelsmith/)
