Ayo, I’m @cecilsmith 😎 --a young dev looking to do some pretty cool projects--

I've dabbled in all sorts of stuff: from game development in Unity, to programming and building drones, but I'd say that I'm strongest in Web development, Java ☕️, and C.

If you'd like to reach me about something, feel free to contact me at 𝕚𝕨𝕖𝕓𝕒𝕡𝕡𝕕𝕖𝕧@𝟘𝕌𝕋𝕃𝟘𝟘𝕂.ℂ𝟘𝕄
